Orderable works with the ecommerce plugin, WooCommerce (it even installs it for you). So you can use any online payment providers that WooCommerce offers (PayPal, Credit Card, Apple Pay, and more), add fees, and accept coupons.

## Orderable’s (Free) Features in Detail ##

The core Orderable plugin is 100% free. With this, you can start taking online orders in a matter of minutes. Here are the features that make Orderable the smart choice for your restaurant business.

**✔️ Online Ordering Menu**

By using Orderable, you’ll be able to create your online food menu in minutes.

Once you’ve created your menu items/dishes, you can add them to an online menu that you customize. Display it as a grid or list layout, include images or not, and decide what you want to happen when a customer clicks on a dish.

**✔️ Zero Transaction Fees**

Orderable charges zero fees per transaction, and there are no hidden costs.

The only time you might need to pay extra is when upgrading to the Pro version of Orderable for extra features (scroll down to see what those are).

**✔️ Delivery/Pickup Date Slots**

Orderable allows you to select which days of the week you offer your pickup or delivery services and what delivery zones these apply to.

You’ll be able to add as many of these as you like and customize them for pickup, delivery, and different days of the week.

Let’s say you want to offer pickup only on the weekend. You can. Or you want to offer different delivery days for different delivery zones (with added delivery fees for the distance). You can do that, too.

**✔️ ASAP Delivery**

Allowing customers to select ASAP delivery at the checkout is as easy as turning on a setting in Orderable. This can then be customized further with the following setting.

**✔️ Lead Time and Preorder Days**

Set how long you need to prepare your order with lead time (minutes, hours, days). This is particularly helpful if you want to offer ASAP delivery but need a set period of time to prepare the order.

Preorder days allow you to control how many days in advance customers can order from your restaurant menu.

**✔️ Holiday Scheduling**

With Orderable, you’ll be able to set up specific holiday dates or special occasions where you won’t offer delivery and/or pickup services.

For example, if your store only accepts pickup orders on Christmas Eve, you can set up a holiday schedule to accept only this service without changing your entire schedule.

**✔️ Live Order View**

View, manage, and process orders in real-time with Orderable’s live order screen.

This screen makes a noise when new orders come in and can be filtered for delivery and pickup orders so restaurant managers and kitchen staff can keep track.

**✔️ Receipt/Ticket Printing and Customization**

Print receipts/tickets for each order via the Orders/Live Order View page and the single order screen. This button opens a print dialogue box, allowing you to customize print settings and select your desired printer.

Create and edit receipt layouts with the in-build WordPress block editor. Customize everything from spacing, to colors. With a selection of pre-built layouts (Kitchen, Delivery, Packing, and Order Confirmation), you can get set up in minutes. 

**✔️ Automated Pickup/Delivery Slot Reminder Emails**

Send automated email reminders to customers who haven’t picked their slot yet.

This is particularly useful for customers who checkout using Google or Apple Pay. Or if they forgot to set a date slot at the checkout.

These reminders are optional and can be customized in terms of frequency and number, as well as their contents.

**✔️ Floating Cart Widget**

Instead of taking customers to the default WooCommerce checkout, a floating cart widget lets them see their order at a glance.

You can customize where product information and the description appear in this layout.

## Take It a Step Further With Orderable Pro ##

The premium version of Orderable provides you with a whole host of revenue-boosting and scheduling features. If you’re looking to take online ordering up a notch, [Orderable Pro](https://orderable.com/pricing/?utm_source=orderable&utm_medium=wp.org&utm_campaign=readme) is for you.

**Here are all the additional features you get with Orderable Pro:**

* **Table Ordering** - Accept table orders via your online menu with printable QR codes assigned to table numbers. Perfect for contactless ordering.
* **Multiple Store Locations** - Create multiple different store locations on one website and have customers select their closest location on the front end of your site before ordering.
* **Product Add-Ons** - Offer add-ons such as toppings, sauces, and customization with Orderable Pro. Charge additional fees should you wish to.
* **Order Bumps** - Use cross-selling for your online food delivery website with order bumps. Encourage customers to buy additional items, such as desserts or sauces, right in the floating cart widget.
* **Custom Checkout** - Upgrade the default WooCommerce checkout with one designed specifically for food ordering websites.
* **Checkout Tipping** - Include tipping at the checkout and increase your average order value. Customize default tip amounts or offer a custom tip as determined by the customer.
* **Timed Products** - Set up products/product categories that only appear on your menu for certain days of the week or times of the day. Perfect for breakfast/lunch menus.
* **Maximum Orders Per Day/Slot** - Determine the maximum number of orders you can take per day or per time slot to keep on top of your orders.
* **Custom Order Statuses** - Create order statuses that are custom to your business and delivery system. For example, ‘Prepping,’ ‘Ready for Delivery,’ or ‘Quality Control.’
* **SMS, Email, & WhatsApp Notifications** - Based on your order statuses, send order notifications to customers, staff, or delivery drivers via email, SMS, or WhatsApp.
* **Dietary & Promotional Product Labels** - Customize your menu with product labels that show off specific dish features. For example, ‘Vegan,’ ‘Gluten Free,’ or ‘Chef Special.’
* **Nutritional Information** - Add a table of nutritional information to your dish’s description by filling in some easy-to-use fields.
